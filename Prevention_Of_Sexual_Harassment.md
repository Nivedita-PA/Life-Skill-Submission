# Prevention of Sexual Harassment  

## Q1. What behaviours amount to sexual harassment?  

Sexual harassment refers to any unwelcome act that makes another person feel uneasy, threatened, or disrespected. Examples include:  
- **Physical acts**: unwanted touching, patting, grabbing, or blocking someone’s way.  
- **Verbal comments**: remarks on looks, double-meaning jokes, sexual comments, or persistent flirting.  
- **Non-verbal actions**: staring, suggestive gestures, displaying inappropriate images/videos.  
- **Online misconduct**: sending offensive texts, images, emails, or repeated unwanted messages.  
- **Power misuse**: asking for favours in return for promotions/benefits or threatening someone’s job security.

## Q2. What steps should you take if you experience or witness harassment?  

If such behaviour occurs:  
- **Respond if safe** – Tell the person directly that the behaviour is not acceptable.  
- **Record details** – Write down the date, time, location, and people involved.  
- **Report the incident** – Approach the Internal Committee (IC), HR, or designated authority under the PoSH policy.  
- **Encourage others** – If you are a witness, support the affected person and stand by them if they report.  
- **Take it seriously** – Do not dismiss repeated small incidents; they must also be reported.

## Q3. Learning from scenario-based videos  

- The videos depict workplace situations (such as inappropriate jokes, gestures, or touching) to highlight what harassment looks like.  
- They help distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.  
- They demonstrate correct responses — saying “No,” reporting to HR/IC, and offering support to colleagues.

## Q4. Ways to deal with harassment cases

- Avoid staying silent — escalate the matter to the IC, HR, or manager.  
- Maintain a written record of the incident (when, where, who).  
- Offer support to others who might be going through the same.
