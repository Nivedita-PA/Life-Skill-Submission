# Focus Management

## What is Deep Work
- **Definition**: The ability to focus on demanding tasks without distraction.  
- **State of Flow**: Involves intense concentration with minimized interruptions (no multitasking or notifications).  
- **High-Value Work**: Applied to tasks that challenge creativity, analysis, and learning to produce meaningful results.

## How to Do Deep Work Properly (Cal Newport)
- **Work Without Distractions**  
  Focus in a completely distraction-free environment.  
- **Push Cognitive Limits**  
  Tackle challenging tasks that require deep thinking, not shallow work.  
- **Structure Your Time**  
  Schedule regular deep work sessions to train focus and build ability.
  
## How can you implement the principles in your day to day life?
- **Schedule Deep Work Blocks**  
  Set fixed focus hours (e.g., 1–2 hrs in the morning). No email, phone, or multitasking.  
- **Prioritize High-Value Tasks**  
  Use deep work time for demanding tasks (coding, writing, learning), not shallow ones (emails).  
- **Reduce Distractions**  
  Silence phone, close tabs, block notifications. Create a distraction-free environment.  =
- **Train Your Focus**  
  Begin with 30–45 mins of focus. Increase duration gradually to build mental stamina.  
- **Embrace Boredom**  
  Avoid reaching for your phone when bored. This builds tolerance for stillness and aids focus.  
- **Have a Shutdown Ritual**  
  End the day by reviewing progress, planning tomorrow, then mentally “log off” from work.  
- **Balance Deep & Shallow Work**  
  Do shallow tasks (emails, admin, meetings) in batches outside deep work hours.  

## What are the dangers of social media, in brief?
- **Addictive** – Designed to hijack attention with notifications and endless scrolling.  
- **Hurts focus** – Constant checking reduces your ability to concentrate and do deep work.  
- **Mental health risks** – Linked to anxiety, loneliness, depression, and feelings of inadequacy.
