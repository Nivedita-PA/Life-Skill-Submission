# Good Practices for Software Development

## Which point(s) were new to you?
- **Using tools like Trello or Jira for documenting requirements** – I usually just note things down, but I hadn’t thought about sharing them immediately for feedback.  
- **Keeping video turned on during meetings** – This was new to me; I usually keep it off, but I now see how it helps build rapport.  
- **Using screencasts (like Loom), Github gists, or CodeSandbox to ask questions** – I wasn’t aware of these specific tools for making my questions clearer.  
- **Joining meetings 5–10 mins early to bond with teammates** – That’s a simple but effective tip I hadn’t considered.  
- **Blocking social media with tools like TimeLimit or Freedom** – I’ve never used such apps before, so that’s new to me.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on?  
I think I need to improve on over communication and asking better questions when I am stuck. Sometimes, I try to solve things on my own for too long instead of reaching out with a clear and structured query.  

## What are your ideas to make progress in that area?  
- I will practice explaining my problems more clearly, mentioning what I have already tried and using screenshots or code snippets where needed.    
- I will actively update my team about progress, delays, or blockers through group channels instead of private messages.  
- I will also try to keep my communication short, precise, and solution-oriented to respect my teammate's time.
