# Life process

## Question 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
- The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you explain a concept in simple words as if teaching a beginner to expose gaps in your understanding and reinforce mastery.

## Question 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The most interesting story for me was Barbara Oakley’s own journey. She shared how she struggled with math and science as a student, but later in life she completely retrained her brain and became an engineer and professor. This stood out to me because it shows that learning isn’t fixed—it’s a skill we can build with the right techniques. If she could transform her weakness into her strength, then with consistent practice and smart methods, anyone, including me, can master even the toughest subjects.

## Question 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
### Active (Focused) Mode:

- This is when you concentrate deeply on a problem or concept, like solving a coding question step by step.

- It uses familiar neural pathways, so you can work on details and practice what you already know.

### Diffused Mode:

- This is when your brain is relaxed and wandering, like while walking, showering, or before sleep.

- It helps you see the bigger picture, make creative connections, and find new solutions.

## Question 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- Deconstruct the skill

- Learn enough to self-correct

- Remove distractions

- Commit to at least 20 hours of practice

## Question 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- I’ll learn smarter, not just harder, by practicing consistently, testing myself, and balancing focus with rest.
